    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Saipuram is a 400-year-old village known for its rich Vedic education and religious rituals, including Yagna and Chayanam. At the time, the local ruler for the Hyderabad princely state, Kondapalli Raj, donated 800 acres to 8 Brahman families that were invited to live here. Without the knowledge of the Nawab, he also constructed several temples for Hindu deities. The Nawab was furious when he learned of this and to pacify him, Kondapalli Raj said he constructed the village in the name of the Nawabâ€™s spouse. So, the town was originally named Shahban Puram.</p>
    <p>Many Brahmins from Saipuram have since moved away for better opportunities, yet those who remain and others connected to the village continue to work for its welfare and the upkeep of its temples.</p>
    <p>The village's 400-year-old <a href="narasimhaswamy.html">Narasimha Swamy temple</a>, once in ruins, was recently reconstructed with meticulous adherence to traditional rituals, funded by donations amounting to 50 lakh rupees. The deities, Lord Narasimha and Lord Shiva, are revered for their power, with numerous devotees reporting miraculous experiences.</p>
    <p>Saipuram is known for its well-attended festivals, including Dussehra, Laksha Patti Puja in Kartikamasam, Narasimha Jayanthi in Vaisakha, and Laksha Tulasi Puja in Margasira Masam. The Lakshmi Narasimha Charitable Trust offers free boarding and lodging for Brahmin devotees with advance notice and has constructed Guru Nilayam to accommodate visiting spiritual leaders from the Darts Peetham. The temple also owns a lake, enhancing its serene environment.</p>
